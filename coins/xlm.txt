Stellar is a distributed, hybrid blockchain that is fully open-source. It is infrastructure that exists to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value, including payments. With just one integration into the Stellar Network, you will join an open, global financial network where all actors – be they people, payment networks, or banks – have equal access & economic participation.
The nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation supports the Stellar network and protocol with the goal of providing efficient and low-cost global financial services. The network's distributed ledger records money as credit issued by third parties such as banks and payment processors. Credit is issued to a user's online wallet in exchange for a deposit and can be sent to others in the network for a low fee. Currencies are automatically exchanged at the lowest rate via Stellar's distributed exchange. Lumens, the native asset of the Stellar network, help to secure the network and provide liquidity for multi-currency transactions.
