SALT lets you leverage your blockchain assets to secure cash loans.
The SALT Lending Platform uses borrowers' blockchain assets as collateral for loans of traditional currencies. This eliminates the need for credit scores, streamlines the lending process, and allows borrowers to obtain cash quickly without selling their crypto assets. SALT tokens are EC20 tokens that represent membership in the lending platform.


SALT streamlines every step of the loan. We've simplified the application process by focusing on the value of the borrowerâ€™s blockchain assets instead of their credit score. Borrowers are automatically matched with capital from our extensive network of lenders. SALT keeps collateral assets safe in a fully-audited, ultra-secure architecture during the life of the loan so members can borrow with confidence.
The SALT Lending Platform uses borrowers' blockchain assets as collateral, eliminating the need for credit scores and streamlining the lending process. Borrowers store their collateral in SALT's secure wallet throughout the life of a loan. The platform automatically matches borrowers with capital (in traditional fiat currencies) from its network of lenders. This allows borrowers to leverage their crypto assets for cash quickly and easily without having to sell their long-term holdings. SALT tokens are ERC20 tokens that represent membership in the platform.
