Sia is a cloud-based data storage platform for peer-to-peer contracts on a blockchain network
Sia is a cloud-based data storage platform for peer-to-peer contracts on a blockchain network. The structure of Sia is decentralized, it allow hosts to lease out digital storage space to renters on a peer-to-peer contractual basis. A Proof-of-Storage protocol enforces the storage contracts and maximizes network fidelity
