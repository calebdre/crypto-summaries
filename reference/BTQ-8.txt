BitQuark is the result of merging Bitcoin with the super secure hashing power of Quarkcoin.  BitQuark uses Bitcoin's distribution method with the addition of 0. 5% annual inflationary after the initial 21,000,000 BitQuark's have been mined.  It uses the super secure 'quark' algorithm made up of 9 rounds of hashing from 6 hashing functions (blake, bmw, gr√∏stl, JH, keccak, skein).  3 rounds apply a random hashing function.  BTQ has a block time of 30 seconds and block rewards of 2. 5 BTQ per block.  The block rewards will never fall below 0
