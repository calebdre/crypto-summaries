NEO is a platform in which users can issue and trade assets..  NEO has been rebranded from the original 'Antshares'..  NEO tokenizes proofs of ownership of an asset and not the asset itself, thus taking into account all of the legal complications and obligations that may come with the transfer of shares, equity and assets.
