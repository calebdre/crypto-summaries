Waves is a decentralized financial trading platform written in Scala and built on its own blockchain with custom tokens being its main feature. Custom tokens, or 'Custom Application Tokens',(CATs for short), allow for a wide range of uses. They enable decentralized crowdfunding as well as transferring, trading and storing of fiat and digital currencies. In essence, a custom token can represent any value assigned to it while being cryptographically secured through the Waves blockchain. A decentralized, manipulation-free voting system will allow projects built on top of the platform to communicate and make decisions hand in hand with their community.
