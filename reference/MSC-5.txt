Mastercoin is both a new type of currency (MSC) and a platform.  It is a new protocol layer running on top of bitcoin like HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP.  Its purpose is to build upon the core Bitcoin protocol and add new features, with a focus on a straight-forward easy to understand implementation which allow for protocol and analysis and its rapid development.  Many of the functionalities are theoretical at this point (and ripple has first-mover advantage), but Mastercoin&#39;s definitely worth watching.
