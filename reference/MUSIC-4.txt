Musicoin is blockchain platform designed specifically for music licensing and consumption.  Musicoin will allow musicians to independently license and release their music such that each playback will trigger a payment from the listener directly to the musician.  Payments are nearly instantaneous and can be automatically divided and distributed to all contributors, such as band members, songwriters, and producers.  Whenever a track released by a musician is played the <span> Pay-Per-Play license (PPP)</span> license code will be triggered and the payment from the listener will be automatically divided and distributed according to the terms of the PPP license
