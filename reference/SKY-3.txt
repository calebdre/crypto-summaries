Skycoin is a cryptocurrency written from scratch in Golang..  It does not use PoW nor PoS and relies instead on Obelisk, a network consensus algorithm, replaces both PoW and PoS with a web of trust..  Skycoin is focused on core features, security, usability and simplifying Bitcoin instead of adding features as a marketing gimmick.
