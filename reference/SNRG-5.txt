Synergy is a peer-to-peer decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a dual-algorithm system to mine blocks.  For the first 10 days, which contains the full PoW (proof of work) period, Synergy uses the X11 algorithm.  Because X11 is unnecessarily inefficient after PoW, Synergy switches to SHA256d for the PoS period (proof of stake).  SHA256d is easier on CPUs during syncronization and bootstrap because it requires only two hashes to verify a block whereas X11 requires 11 hashes.
