Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available.  DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way.  All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates.  Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second.  Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference
