StableCoin is a new type of decentralized currency.  SBC has what it calls the optimised block time of 40 seconds - to play the balance between orphaned blocks and transaction confirmation time - i. e.  Forking issues.  Difficulty is retargetted every 90 blocks and the coin reward is set to 25 coins after block 900
