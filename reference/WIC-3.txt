The idea behind CryptoWi is to bring cryptocurrencies to the masses and to give cryptocurrencies a real meaning and porpuse, making it an everyday manetary instrument..  This will be achieved through a WiFi sharing app which is monetized so that the general public has an incentive for using it..  The user is awarded with CryptoWi tokens (WIC) for each correct correct password uploaded in order to grow the network initially.
