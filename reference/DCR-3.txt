Decred is an open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain..  At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus..  The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013.
