Aeternity is a scalable blockchain platform that enables high bandwidth transacting, purely-functional smart contracts, and decentralized oracles..  The use of the blockchain is not free, and requires that the user spends a token called Aeon..  Aeon's are used as payment for any resources one consumes on the platform, as well as the basis for financial applications implemented on the platform.
