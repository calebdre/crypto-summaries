<span>UPcoin, is designed to only run for a short 6weeks.  This short timeframe concept idea is designed that all IPO funds will be spent to purchase cloud mining equipment via HashNest (antminer s4/s5) to produce profits daily, which will be used to buy [XUP] straight off the order books, and then be burned.  The coins will be burned daily from day 1 all the way till day 42, in addition to this burn, every week one antminer s4/s5 will be sold off, and the funds will be used to buy straight off the the sell order books.  This idea is branched off the idea of a drastically decreasing supply over a very short period of time.  After the 6 weeks, the coin will not be abandoned, we will collaborate with our team and the developers and pick a brand new/fresh approach to the success of the coin, and the rest of its lifespan
