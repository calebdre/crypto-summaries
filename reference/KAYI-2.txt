Kayi is a dividend-paying asset issued on the Waves Platform..  The dividends will be shared in the form of Waves tokens to shareholders who keep their KAYI in a local wallet not on an exchange, although it's unclear where these dividends will come from as no plan has been publicly outlined by Kayi.
