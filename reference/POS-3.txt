PoSToken is the world's first Proof-of-Stake smart contract token on Ethereum platform..  It's based on the ERC20 Token Standard and implements all standard methods..  Furthermore, the idea behind PoSToken is not only to issue a simple Ethereum Token with Proof-of-Stake mechanism but also to define a brand new Token Standard for Proof-of-Stake tokens.
